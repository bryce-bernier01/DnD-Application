# DnD-Application

To Do:
1) Figma Designs for Navigation Bar and Banner
2) Create Banner, Navigation Components and create new views for each components (Spells, Character Creator, etc.)
3) Finish other Figma Designs for each view to get ready to implement items 4-8
4) Database research, learning and implementation. Local instances of databases should be important here
5) Create card component to be used in Spell page, weapon catalog and monster wiki (Pass important props and let display all important information)
6) Spell Page (Requiring database access of some sort? Filter by classes?)
7) Weapon Catalog (Uses database also)
8) Monster Wiki (Use database to insert enemies? Maybe let DM's create custom monsters that they can add?)
9) Character Creation (Intuitive Character Creation. Use database to determine what spells and skills that character can learn?)

Features to implement if we have time:
1) Sign in/Account creation
2) Let Users connect with each other for sessions and groups
3) Session views: Let DM give out exp. points to players characters in a session, implement mapping?, implement scenario creation where DM can add creatures/enemies to scenarios and can keep track of creature's experience, armor rating, weapons, health, etc. all in one place.

DONE:
